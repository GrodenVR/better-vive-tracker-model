# better-vive-tracker-model
better looking model for the HTC vive tracker based off obj conversion of HTC Vive Tracker CAD file by Marco_Romero https://skfb.ly/67p6q
Unfortunatley the specular maps have no effect in the steamvr menu screen and the diffuse maps look very flat. There seems to be only ambient lighting so its pretty limiting on how good you can make the model look.

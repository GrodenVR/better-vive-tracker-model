# better-vive-tracker-model (OUTDATED)
[STEAM HAS RECENTLY UPDATED THEIR MODELS, SO THIS IS NO LONGER NEEDED]

Better looking model for the HTC vive tracker based off obj conversion of HTC Vive Tracker CAD file by Marco_Romero https://skfb.ly/67p6q
Unfortunatley the specular maps have no effect in the steamvr menu screen and the diffuse maps look very flat. There seems to be only ambient lighting so its pretty limiting on how good you can make the model look, but there is still room for improvement. 

Backup the oem tracker files (vr_tracker_vive_1_0.obj, vr_tracker_vive_1_0.mtl, vr_tracker_vive_1_0_diff.png, and vr_tracker_vive_1_0_spec.png). They are located at:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\drivers\htc\resources\rendermodels\vr_tracker_vive_1_0

Replace them with the files provided (spec map was not provided as it had no effect).
